    <p>Throughout my career I have worked with hundreds of high school administrators and counselors in order to help students graduate college and career-ready.</p> 

    <p>At The City University of New York (CUNY), I managed a program that strengthened post-secondary guidance for first-generation students.  I've since supported networks of New York City and Westchester county counselors in creating effective 9th through 12th grade college and career pathways.  Additionally, I've worked within the <a href="http://www.cuny.edu" title="CUNY Website">CUNY</a> and <a href="http://www.suny.edu" title="SUNY Website">SUNY</a> systems on deepening high school partnerships and increasing college retention and graduation rates.</p>

    <p>I received my Bachelor’s degree in English Literature from Binghamton University, and my Master’s degree in Social Policy from SUNY Empire State College.</p>
