    <p>Throughout my career I have served over one hundred public high schools, thousands of underserved students and families, and dozens of high school and college faculty.</p> 

    <p>At The City University of New York (CUNY), I oversaw a college access, transition and success program serving high school and college students throughout NYC.  I have since supported networks of New York City and Westchester county counselors in creating effective 9th through 12th grade college and career pathways.  I have also worked within both the <a href="http://www.cuny.edu" title="CUNY Website">CUNY</a> and <a href="http://www.suny.edu" title="SUNY Website">SUNY</a> systems on increasing college retention and graduation rates.</p>

    <p>I received my Bachelor’s degree in English Literature from Binghamton University, and my Master’s degree in Social Policy from SUNY Empire State College.</p>
