        <div class="intro"> <span class="feature"> Every student deserves a quality education </span>.  I work with non-profit organizations and schools on college access projects that empower students and their communities.  Within organizations, I help clients move from the planning phase to program launch and implementation.  Externally, I build public, private and community partnerships aimed at engaging and supporting students and their families.</div>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="./images/amy2.jpg" alt="Amy Perlow Portrait" class="portrait-image right" />

<p>Throughout my career I have served over one hundred public high schools, thousands of underserved students and families, and dozens of high school and college faculty.</p> 

<p>At The City University of New York (CUNY), I oversaw a college access program that served more than 2,000 high school seniors and 500 college students each year.  I have since supported networks of New York City and Westchester county guidance counselors in creating effective 9th through 12th grade college/career readiness systems.  I have also worked within both the CUNY and SUNY systems to develop and sustain increased college retention and graduation rates.</p>

<p>I received my Bachelor’s degree in English Literature from Binghamton University, and my Master’s degree in Social Policy from SUNY Empire State College.</p>
